2-player chess
16 pieces per player

dark square in ASCII art is ##

Rank: 1 - 8
File: a - h

Game pieces are divided into two sets
White set
Black set

WHITE MOVES FIRST
Then BLACK.
They alternate turns, moving one piece per turn.
EXCEPT FOR CASTLING -- when TWO pieces are moved.

Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or
one occupied by an opponent's piece,
which is captured and REMOVED from play.

With the sole exception of an en passant,
all pieces capture by moving to the square that the
opponent's piece occupies.

A player may not make any move that would put or leave
the player's own king under attack.

A player cannot "pass" a turn;
one must make a LEGAL move.

If the player to move has NO legal move --
the game is over; 
the result is either CHECKMATE
(a loss for the player with no legal move) if the king is in CHECK, 
or STATEMATE (a DRAW) if the king is NOT IN CHECK.

Each piece has its own way of moving.

KING
Moves one square in ANY direction.
Also has a move called CASTLING, that involves moving a rook.

	CASTLING
	ONCE in every game, each king can do a CASTLING.
	Consists of moving the KING TWO SQUARES along the first RANK
	toward a ROOK (that is on the player's first RANK) and then placing
	the ROOK on the last square that the KING just crossed.
	
	CASTLING is permitted if these conditions are met:
		neither the king nor the rook have previously moved during the game
		there are no pieces between the king and the rook
		the king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through
		any square that is under attack by an enemy piece,
		or move to a square that would result in check.
		
		Note that castling is permitted if the rook is attacked,
		or if the rook crosses an attacked square.
		
ROOK

White's move: 



All Piece subtypes coexist in same Board instance


All Pieces share:
	Current position data
	the ability to 'move' - subclasses determine HOW they move, however.
	
	Using its current position data
	and its move set abilities --
	we can determine if that piece is able to move at all during a turn. 
	
	'active' data - is the piece still in the game?
